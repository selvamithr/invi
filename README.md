The 'Artishop' app aims to connect artisans and creators of handicraft and handloom products worldwide. The primary goal is to provide a platform for talented individuals who lack opportunities to showcase their skills and earn a livelihood. This initiative serves as a means to alleviate or mitigate poverty by empowering those with skills but without avenues to monetize their talents.
